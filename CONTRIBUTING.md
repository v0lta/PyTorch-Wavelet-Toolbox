## Contributing to the PyTorch-Wavelet-Toolbox

Contributions to the PyTorch-Wavelet-Toolbox are always welcome!

### Development workflow:
We use nox to run our unit tests. Before creating your pull request follow these three steps.

1. Make sure all unit tests are passing.
Run:
``` bash
nox -s test
```
to check.

2. Help yourself by running,
``` bash
nox -s format
```
to take care of linting issues, with an automatic fix.

3. Afterward, run 
``` bash
nox -s lint
```
to learn where manual fixes are required for style compatability.
