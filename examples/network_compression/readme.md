## Adaptive Wavelet examples
```mnist_compression.py``` trains a CNN on MNIST with a wavelet
compressed linear layer.
See https://arxiv.org/pdf/2004.09569v3.pdf for a detailed description of the method.

To run it clone this repository and run ```ipython examples/network_compression/mnist_compression.py```
from the main directory.
